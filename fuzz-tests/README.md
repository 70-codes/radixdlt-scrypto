# Introduction

This package implements fuzz tests for Radix Engine.
Currently it uses 3 fuzzing engines:
* [LibFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)
  It is wrapped by crate: [cargo-fuzz](https://docs.rs/crate/cargo-fuzz/0.11.2)
* [AFLplusplus](https://aflplus.plus/)
  It is wrapped by crate: [cargo-afl](https://docs.rs/afl/0.12.14/afl)
* simple-fuzzer
  This is a very simple fuzzer, which is especially useful when developing new fuzz tests.
  It allows to:
  - quickly rebuild a test and perform some simple checks (building libfuzzer or AFL takes ages).
  - reproduce a crash (or other problematic case) using provided input file,
    (which might be generated by libfuzzer or AFL)

# LibFuzzer
* At the moment it is possible to use it only with rust `nightly` builds.
* Must be built with `no-cfg-fuzzing` option, to skip setting `fuzzing` flag.
  Crate `secp256k1` uses some stubs instead of true cryptography if `fuzzing` is set
  (for details see: https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1/#fuzzing), which makes it unusable
  for our purposes.
* It does not require fuzz input data, but it is preferred to provide it to increase fuzzing efficiency.

## Installation
```
cargo +nightly install cargo-fuzz
```

# AFL
* Similarly to `libfuzzer` it sets `fuzzing` flag by default. Unfortunately there is no easy switch to disable that.
  Thus `cargo afl` shall be built and installed using this [modification](https://github.com/lrubasze/afl.rs/commit/16c25fd74aec105c1b75c1b046e8dfd6b6fd3175)
* It requires some input data to be provided.

## Installation
One can use convenience script [install_afl.sh](./install_afl.sh) to install `cargo-afl` with the change mentioned above.

## Machine setup
Before starting to fuzz AFL checks machine configuration and requests to adjust some settings if required.
* Linux
  - do not send core dump notifications to external utilities.
    This is to notify fuzzer immediately about the crash, so it does not misinterpret crash as timeout.
    `sudo bash -c "echo core > /proc/sys/kernel/core/core_pattern"`

    Alternatively it is possible to use env `AFL_I_DONT_CARE_ABOUT_MISSING_CRASHES=1`
  - disable CPU frequency scaling to provide best performance
    `sudo bash -c "cd /sys/devices/system/cpu ; echo performance | tee cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor >/dev/null"`

    Alternatively it is possible to use env `AFL_SKIP_CPUFREQ=1`

* MacOS
  If you see an error message like `shmget() failed` above, try running the following command:
  ```
  sudo /Users/<username>/.local/share/afl.rs/rustc-1.67.1-d5a82bb/afl.rs-0.12.14/afl/bin/afl-system-config
  ```

# Input data
Sample input data shall be placed in [fuzz_input](./fuzz_input) folder in dedicated subfolder.
`libfuzzer` and `AFL` are able to use the data in the same format.

In order to minimize the test corpus, the data might prior processed.
Processing method is specific for fuzzing engine.

# Fuzz tests
Available fuzz tests:
* transaction - Fuzzes transaction manifests and tries to execute it

# Usage

Helper script [fuzz.sh](./fuzz.sh) to unify fuzzing experience accross the fuzzing engines ;)

`./fuzz.sh [FUZZER] [COMMAND] [COMMAND-ARGS]`

Currently it allows to build and run fuzz tests using some default configuration.
Check: `./fuzz.sh help` for more details.

For more sophisticated use cases `cargo fuzz` or `cargo afl` shall be used directly.
Check:
`cargo +nightly fuzz --help`
or
`cargo afl --help`

# TODO

- Run more worker processes in parallel for `LibFuzzer`
- Add more fuzz tests
- Add easy to use option to reconstruct sample input data.
  (eg. for transaction tests it is transaction manifest serialized to raw bytes)
- any ideas?
