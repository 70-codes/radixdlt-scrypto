# Note we explicitly opt-in to source controlling the workspace Cargo.lock
# Whilst this isn't typical for libraries (http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/cargo/faq.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries)
# this is because we are building the CLI application.
# This Cargo.lock is ignored for users pulling in the crates as libraries, or building scrypto packages
# Sure applications will maintain their own Cargo.lock

# Old (ignored) cargo locks of crates now part of central workspace
# These will be ignored by cargo now.
# Keep these git'ignored so that they don't cause confusion on developers' computers

# Also - continue to ignore the scrypto Cargo.locks for now
# We should source control these at some point (and put up with the painful developer merge conflicts)
# ... or create separate sub-workspaces for each of them to move the problem and solve in a nicer way!
